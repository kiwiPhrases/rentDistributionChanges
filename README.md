# rentDistributionChanges
I compare the distribution of rents between 2009-2013 and 2013-2017 ACS surveys at the block group level in LA County. I believe this is a better metric of change than comparing changes in median rents because my metric explicitly accounts for the disappearance of low cost units and their replacement with high cost units. 


I want an index that shows whether the rent distribution has shifted upward or downward across the years but I do not have micro level data. Moreover, using this index, I wish to compare the size and direction of the shift between geographies so that geographies with a high index experienced a rightward shift in the rent distribution (thus became more expensive) while geographies with a low index experienced a leftward shift in the rent distribution (thus became less expensive). I am not aware of any such metrics so I propose one here and map it.
